# JUnit Testing Course Exercises

Welcome to my JUnit Testing course repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Course Details

I am currently enrolled in a comprehensive JUnit Testing course on Udemy to enhance my skills and knowledge in unit testing with Java. This repository will serve as my learning journal, where I will commit all the exercises, projects, and notes I work on throughout the course.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this course and repository are:

1. **Deepen Unit Testing Knowledge**: Gain a thorough understanding of JUnit framework and best practices in unit testing.
2. **Practical Application**: Apply learned concepts through hands-on exercises and real-world examples.
3. **Improve Java Development Skills**: Strengthen my overall Java development skills by incorporating robust unit testing in my coding practices.
4. **Documentation and Sharing**: Document my learning journey and share it with others who may benefit from these resources.

## Course Outline

Throughout this course, I will be learning:

- Introduction to JUnit
- Writing basic tests
- Understanding test lifecycle
- Assertions and assumptions
- Parameterized tests
- Testing exceptions
- Using Mockito
- Testing REST Controllers, JPA Repositories
- Testing All Layers of a SpringBoot Application
- Testing Data Layers Only
- Advanced JUnit features
- Integration with build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle)
- Best practices in unit testing
